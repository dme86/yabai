# yabai

This is my attempt to utilize a tiling window manager on macOS. Usually, I work under Linux with [dwm](https://github.com/dme86/dwm), but I also need something similar on macOS. I will execute this project using yabai, skhd, and sketchybar.

## keybindings

Keybindings are implemented through [skhd](https://github.com/dme86/yabai/blob/main/.skhdrc).

|Key  | Description |
|--|--|
| `Shift` + `Opt/Alt` + `Enter`|Open [Alacritty](https://github.com/dme86/alacritty)  |
|`Opt/Alt` + `h`|focus previous or next window in window tree|
|`Opt/Alt` + `f`|toggle window zoom|
|`Opt/Alt` + `e`|toggle window split type|
